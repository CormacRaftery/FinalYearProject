Research into viable project idea

After researching into what type of project would interest me I 
decided that a game would be the most interesting project but a 
simple game would not be enough and it would need to incorporate 
a database and perhaps a multiplayer functionality. A strategy 
game would be best suited towards the goal of the project as it 
entails less graphic design than any other game. Chess has been 
done numerous times so to try something new I decided to try to 
recreate the game "Khet".

Decide on technologies

For the dissertation Overleaf is a very useful tool as it 
allows for the dissertation to be written in Latex which has 
proved intuitive over previous projects.

The hottest game engine right now is unity and having used 
to in a module in first semester it seemed like the smartest 
choice.

A sql database where the player can retain data between games 
seemed like something I would like to become more familiar 
with so after researching sql databases I decided that a MAMP 
server would be acceptable to meet this goal.

Begin work on khet

After spending many hours trying to develop the game khet I 
decided that it would take far too much time so it was time 
to re-evaluate the project goals and select an easier game. 

With the deadline rapidly approaching I made the difficult 
decision that the multiplayer functionality and saving the 
game to a database was more important.

Tic-Tac-Toe
Game has been changed to tic-tac-toe and basic 
functionality has been completed. (No multiplayer and no database)

9/08/2020 - 16/08/2020

SQL database
Database has been incorporated into the Tic-Tac-Toe game successfully.

16/08/2020 - 30/08/2020

Multiplayer functionality

After struggling for far too long to get a successful 
server-client game running I had no choice but to focus 
on other aspects of the project.
