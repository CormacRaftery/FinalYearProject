Research into viable project idea

After researching into what type of project would interest me I 
decided that a game would be the most interesting project but a 
simple game would not be enough and it would need to incorporate 
a database and perhaps a multiplayer functionality. A strategy 
game would be best suited towards the goal of the project as it 
entails less graphic design than any other game. Chess has been 
done numerous times so to try something new I decided to try to 
recreate the game "Khet".

Decide on technologies

For the dissertation Overleaf is a very useful tool as it 
allows for the dissertation to be written in Latex which has 
proved intuitive over previous projects.

The hottest game engine right now is unity and having used 
to in a module in first semester it seemed like the smartest 
choice.

A sql database where the player can retain data between games 
seemed like something I would like to become more familiar 
with so after researching sql databases I decided that a MAMP 
server would be acceptable to meet this goal.
